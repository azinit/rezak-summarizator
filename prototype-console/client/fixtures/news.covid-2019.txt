All shops and public food services are closed in the Czech Republic until March 24 to "prevent the spread of the coronavirus contagion," according to a news release from the Czech Republic's Ministry of Health. 

"In the present situation, we see the gathering of people in shopping centres and in restaurants as too great a risk," Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said. "By no means do we want to restrict the sale of food, pharmaceuticals, druggist goods, and fuel and other essentials. People do not need to worry: food supplies remain unrestricted and it really is not necessary for people to empty store-shelves of goods." 
Exceptions include dining services that do not serve the general public and fast food establishments, the release said. Exceptions include stores selling food, hygienic or medical products, fuel or tobacco products, electronic or telecommunication equipment, animal food or cleaning services, or newspaper and magazines. 

"Only fundamental restrictions like this can help stop the spread of the infection in our country," said Adam Vojtěch, Minister of Health. "Even though it is not pleasant for any of us, this is about protecting our health."
