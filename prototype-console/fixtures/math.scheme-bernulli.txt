Now, we already discuss a very important Bernoulli scheme. It is a probabilistic model that represents a series of independent trials. Each trial can result either in success or in failure. We will model the sequence by sequence of coin testing. However, now, this is not a fair coin, but some unbalanced coin for which probability of head is different from probability of tail. To find the probabilities of outcomes in this random experiment, we have to use independence condition. Now, let us go to formulas. Let us assume that we toss a coin two times. So n the overall number of tossings is equal to 2. In this case, we can consider two events. H1, first tossing, Gives head. And H2, second tossing gives head. Of course, in the first tossing and in the second tossing, we use the same coin. So the probability of H1 is the same as the probability of H2. We'll denote this probability by P. In this experiment, we have four outcomes. We will denote them as usual by HH, HT, TH, and TT. However, in this case, when our coin is not necessarily fail, we cannot just say that probabilities of all of these outcomes are equal and equal to one-fourth. Because it is true only in case when the probability of head is in the same as probability of tail. However, we can use independence assumption to find probabilities of these outcomes. To do so, let us take into account the fact that H1 and H2 are independent.
